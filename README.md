# lvm-cache

## Warnings

This role is currently designed for pretty custom lvm setup, please apply it carefully or just use as a reference.

Role is Ubuntu oriented and as dm-cache is not available in 14.04 it performs upgrade to 16.04 and reboots your server.

## Usage

```yml
- hosts: dm-cached
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  roles:
      - { role: dm-cache, hdd_lv: rootfs, ssd_drive: sdb1 }
```
